# The Scratch Weather Dashboard

In this resource, you will be creating a basic weather dashboard, to monitor the weather at stations all over the world.

## Fetching the `interface.py` file

For Scratch to be able to talk to weather stations around the world, it needs a little help. There's a complicated Python script that you can run, that will help Scratch chat to weather stations.

1. Open up a terminal, by pressing the `ctrl`, `alt` and `t` keys all at the same time, or by clicking on the icon in the left hand corner of the screen.

1. Into the terminal type the following command to get the Python file.

```bash
 wget -O interface.py https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raspberrypilearning/scratching-the-weather/master/code/interface.py?token=AETp8m9CBcAxVOOTmuLO7X9K7cXqPRcrks5YQZB_wA%3D%3D
```
- not get shortened URL off BEN

1. That's it, you have downloaded the file. Keep the terminal open though, as you'll need it in a minuter

## Setting up Scratch

Now we need to help Scratch talk to the file you have downloaded.

1. Open up Scratch by clicing on `Menu` > `Programming` > `Scratch`

1. Now click on the 

1. Now do C in code:

    ```python
    print("Hello world")
    ```

    In Python the `print` function is something

1. Now do D:

    Wire up the button to pin 17 and ground

1. Now do X

Now we have X

## The Next Step

Now we've done X, we'll do Y.

1. First do A

1. Then do B

1. Now do C in code:

    ```python
    print("Hello world")
    ```

    In Python the `print` function is something

1. Now do D

1. Now do Y

Now we have X and Y
